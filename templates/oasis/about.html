                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-10 pt-5">
                    <p>
                        At the COP21 conference on climate in Paris, the global community expressed its commitment to the reduction of harmful emissions into the atmosphere. Together with renewable energy sources, natural gas, being an environmentally friendly fuel, can play a significant role in the development of low-carbon economy of the future, and in achievement of targets stipulated at COP21.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The substitution of coal by natural gas in power generation can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions (“carbon footprint”) and pollutant emissions (“toxic footprint”): nitrogen oxides - by up to 32%, sulfur dioxide - by up to 99%, carbon monoxide - by up to 68%, ash and soot - by up to 100%, carbon dioxide - by up to 50%. In many regions of the world, use of gas can prevent smoke fog and impact positively on the environment and people's health.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Natural gas can become a basis for the future low-carbon energy. Tank Oil Impex SRL already performs practical projects to develop innovative technologies to product methane hydrogen mixes and hydrogen from natural gas without carbon dioxide emissions. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gasification of transport also offers good opportunities. It is estimated that using gas as  motor fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-30% in comparison with petrol and diesel fuel. “Toxic footprint” of NGV for the whole production chain is three times smaller than by petrol-engine cars, and five times smaller than by diesel ones. More detailed information is in Gas Motor Fuel Section.
